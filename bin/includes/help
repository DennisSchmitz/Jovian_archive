Jovian, Public Health Toolkit version $VERSION, built with Snakemake
  N.B. Current version only supports Illumina paired-end data, ONT compatibility is upcoming.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Use case 1, agnostic metagenomic analysis including virus typing (see below):
      bash jovian -i <INPUT_DIR> <parameters>
Use case 2, align against user-provided reference genome to generate a consensus genome:
      bash jovian -i <INPUT_DIR> -ra <REFERENCE_FASTA> <parameters>
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
Input:
  -i, --input [DIR]                 This is the folder containing your input fastq files.
                                    Default is 'raw_data/' and only relative paths are accepted.
Output (automatically generated):
  data/                             Contains detailed intermediate files.
  logs/                             Contains all log files.
  results/                          Metagenomics workflow only. Contains all final results and
                                    audit-trail. Results are visualized via the Jovian report.
  reference_alignment/              Reference alignment workflow only. Contains detailed
                                    intermediate files. Results are found in the "results/"
                                    sub-folder.
Virus typing:
  -vt-help, --virus-typing-help     Print additional information about the virus-typing, i.e.
                                    which family/genus is selected and which species are typed.
  -vt, --virus-typing [all|NoV|EV|RVA|HAV|HEV|PV|Flavi]
                                    After a Jovian analyses has completed, do viral typing for
                                    Norovirus (NoV), Enterovirus (EV), Hepatitis A (HAV), 
                                    Hepatitis E (HEV), Rotavirus A (RVA), Papillomaviruses (PV),
                                    Flaviviruses (Flavi). Or use the 'all' keyword to perform
                                    virus typing for all above listed viruses.
                                    For additional explanation, --vt-help
  -vt-force, --virus-typing-force [NoV|EV|RVA|HAV|HEV|PV|Flavi]
                                    Same as above, but overwrites existing output. 
Parameters:
  -m, --mode [strict|relaxed]       Automatically configures Jovian to be stringent or relaxed
                                    in taxonomic classification of scaffolds. Please see the 
                                    publication for details. In short, use 'strict' for high 
                                    precision at the cost of sensitivity and use 'relaxed' for
                                    high sensitivity at the cost of more spurious results
                                    (contamination). Default: relaxed.
  -h, --help                        Print the Jovian help document.
  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print the Snakemake help document.
  --clean (-y)                      Removes all Jovian output, both the metagenomics output and
                                    reference alignment output. (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts)
  -k, --keep-going                  Useful snakemake command: Go on with independent jobs if
                                    a job fails.
  -n, --dry-run                     Useful snakemake command: Do not execute anything, and
                                    display what would be done.
  -u, --unlock                      Removes the lock on the working directory. This happens when
                                    a run ends abruptly and prevents you from doing subsequent
                                    analyses.
  -q, --quiet                       Useful snakemake command: Do not output any progress or
                                    rule information.
Archiving Jovian results:
  --archive (-y)                    Archives the output of a Jovian analysis into single
                                    compressed file. (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts)
  --rebuild-archive                 Rebuilds Jovian results and logs from a previously made 
                                    archive. It is important to use the same version of Jovian
                                    as was initially used to build the archive. N.B. databases
                                    are not restored.
Jupyter Notebook (for data visualization):
  --configure-jupyter               Sets the proper Jupyter settings. You only need to do this
                                    once per user.
  --start-jupyter                   Starts a Jupyter Notebook process. You must always have this
                                    running in a separate terminal (or in the background) if you
                                    want to open the final report with the interactive graphs
                                    and tables.
Installation:
  -ic, --install-dependencies       Install the required software dependencies for the
                                    metagenomics and reference alignment workflows.
  -id, --install-databases          Install required databases.
Debug only:
  --start-nginx                     Starts the nginx process.
  --stop-nginx                      Stops the nginx process.
  --make-sample-sheet               Only make the sample sheet.
Other:
  -v, --version                     Print the current version of Jovian.
  --update                          Updates Jovian to the latest release. Some files might be
                                    reset to their default contents as shown on Github.
  --update [Version tag]            Changes Jovian to the specified release. Only accepts major
                                    releases. Files can get deleted in significant version changes.
